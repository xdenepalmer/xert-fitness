/**
 * Decides what the public timetable offers for a single class.
 *
 * Every class carries its own `booking_mode`, which the public site used to
 * ignore entirely — every class showed "Request spot" and nothing ever took a
 * place. The owner now chooses per class:
 *
 *   interest_only    register interest, no spot is held
 *   request_to_book  a request staff confirm, no spot is held
 *   instant_book     sign-ups accepted: the first `capacity` people take a spot
 *
 * Remaining places come from `public_class_availability()`, which counts
 * confirmed public sign-ups alongside member bookings and reports a class as
 * having no places while a member is waitlisted for it. That function also
 * reports the owner's site-wide booking switch (`bookings_open`) and whether a
 * real spot can be taken right now (`can_take_spot`), so the button and the
 * database agree about what pressing it will do.
 *
 * The database is what actually enforces capacity; this module only decides
 * what to show, and fails safe to the non-committal option when availability is
 * unknown.
