-- Returns the credit held by a booking request nobody ever actioned.
--
-- book_session spends the credit and writes the booking as 'requested' in one
-- transaction, so a request-to-book class holds a real credit from the moment a
-- member asks for a place. Roll call counts only
--
--   status in ('confirmed', 'attended', 'no_show')
--
-- when it decides whether the register is complete, so an unactioned
-- 'requested' booking never blocks INCOMPLETE_ROLL_CALL. The class was then
-- flipped to 'completed' with that booking still open and its credit still
-- spent.
--
-- After that the member has no way back. rosterStatusOptions makes the roster
-- read-only for any session that is no longer published, Account files a past
-- booking under history where there is no cancel control, and the iOS app
-- requires start_time in the future. The RPC underneath still accepts the
-- transition, so the credit was recoverable — but only by someone who knew to
-- call it by hand.
--
-- Roll call now releases those requests itself, as part of the same
-- transaction that completes the class, using the refund shape
-- admin_set_booking_status already uses: return the credit to the batch the
-- booking took it from. A request that was never actioned is not a no-show;
-- the member was never given a place, so they should not be charged for it.
--
-- Everything else is unchanged: the register must still cover every confirmed,
-- attended and no-show booking exactly once, attendance is still only reachable
-- from a session that has started, and the returned count is still the number
-- of attendance rows written.
